            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015)
            was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the
            11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He
            also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
            in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
            original nuclear test by India in 1974. Kalam was elected as the
            11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
            Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National
            Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President".

    <h1>Career as a scientist</h1>
  </center>
  <p>
    After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam
    joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research
    and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of
    India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
    Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small
    hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam
    joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space
    scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy,
    the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS). In
    1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
    where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
    (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth
    orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket
    project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the
    government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
    Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati In 1963 to 1964, he
    visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space
    Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28]
    Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar
    Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved
    to be successful.

    <h1>Presidency</h1>
  </center>
  <p>
    Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He
    won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884,
    surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25
    July 2002, to 25 July 2007. On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic
    Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would
    nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi
    Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the
    Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek
    a second term in office, leaving the field clear. Kalam said of the
    announcement of his candidature: I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in
    Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking
    what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture. On 18
    June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament,
    accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues. Kalam along with
    Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency The polling for the
    presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state
    assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair
    and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18
    July. Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy
    victory,

    <h1>Death</h1>
  </center>
  <p>
    On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on
    "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management
    Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort,
    but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[85] At around 6:35
    p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.[86][87] He was
    rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival,
    he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[86] Despite being placed in
    the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest
    at 7:45 p.m. IST.[86][88][89] His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh,
    were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"[90] Following his death,
    Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong
    to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July
    in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that
    afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime
    Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service
    chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body.
